Periodically I'll need a local system's MAC address, either for setting up Wake-On-LAN or confirming router port forwarding settings. 
It's not hard to retrieve it and nowadays router UIs will display it readily, but it's slightly more effort than I want so I decided to make
# clipMAC
Simple script that sends the MAC address of the active network connection to the system clipboard.

Each respective system version should work on the average system install without needing to install additional dependencies.
Simply double-click the script and get the result in your clipboard.

*This windows version does rely on powershell it probably only works with modern installs.*

# Ducky Script / Bad USB / Flipper Zero
I've also provided this for use with the flipper zero or rubber ducky device to expedite the process.
